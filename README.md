# react-crossfade-responsive

> Made with create-react-library

/!\ Work in progress /!\
Please read before using. This is my first publication of a React Component of NPM so it may not be perfect.

This is a very easy-to-use crossfade carousel. I created this one because I experiences in most of the cases issues when using the other ones. (Some of them makes white blinks during the transitions).

[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-crossfade-responsive.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-crossfade-responsive) [![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com)

## Install

```bash
npm install --save react-crossfade-responsive
```

/!\ For the moment it only works with React v17.0.2 /!\

## Usage

To use it, just provide an array of images to the component and pass it as a prop called "images". By default it has 3 random images so you can try instantly.

You can set a specific width and height by setting props :

```jsx
<Crossfade images={testImages} customHeight='300px' customWidth='900px' />
```

By default, it is set as a perfect full-screen.

It is set as "position: relative". So you can put it inside custom container to adjust it.

It is 100% responsive and will adapt to any height/width.

You can customize the interval setting the customInterval prop:

```jsx
<Crossfade images={testImages} customInterval={2000} />
```

1000 = 1 sec.

By default, it is set on 5000.

## Example
